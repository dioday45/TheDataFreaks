# Wikipedia in numbers




# Introduction
Wikipedia, the world's largest online encyclopedia, relies on a community of dedicated contributors to maintain and improve its vast repository of knowledge. Admins (short for administrators) play a crucial role in this ecosystem by overseeing the platform, ensuring its integrity, and facilitating a collaborative and respectful environment for editors. The process through which individuals become administrators is known as the Request for Adminship (RfA). Adminship is not just a privilege but a responsibility, and those seeking this role are expected to have a deep understanding of Wikipedia policies, guidelines, and a history of constructive contributions. All the admins have the ability to delete pages, protect pages from editing, and block users, among other tools. Those tasks necessitate a high level of trust from the community, hence, the importance of robust votations in Wikipedia's administrative elections cannot be overstated. They need to ensure a fair and equitable system. The essence of Wikipedia lies in its commitment to democratic principles, where decisions affecting the community are made collectively. The participation of a diverse and substantial voter base ensures that the outcome is reflective of the broader community's values, preferences, and expectations. A multitude of voters brings a diverse range of perspectives, mitigating the risk of undue influence or bias. The votation process is a crucial mechanism for upholding fairness, transparency, and community consensus, reinforcing Wikipedia's commitment to providing a collaborative platform.


Considering these factors, it is anticipated that candidates would be driven by a commitment to actively engage in the election process and uphold the democratic values ingrained in Wikipedia's governance structure. Their objective should be to ensure that candidates are selected on the basis of their merit, experience, and dedication to the fundamental principles of Wikipedia. However, is it really the case?


In this data story, we aim to address the following questions:


Is the election process as fair as it should ideally be ?
What drives people to vote ?
How could the wikipedia democratic process be improved ?
